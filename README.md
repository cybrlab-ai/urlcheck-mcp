## Overview

The URL Security Scanner is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI agents with the ability to analyze URLs for malicious content and security threats before navigation.

## Important Notice

This tool is intended for authorized security assessment only. Use it solely on systems or websites that you own or for which you have got explicit permission to assess. Any unauthorized, unlawful, or malicious use is strictly prohibited. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.

### Use Cases

- Pre-flight URL validation for AI agents
- Automated URL security scanning in workflows
- Malicious link detection in emails/messages

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Your MCP Client

Add to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "url-scanner": {
      "transport": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://urlcheck.ai/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Optional: Initialize Session (stateful mode only)

```bash
# Only required if the server is running in stateful mode
curl -X POST https://urlcheck.ai/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "initialize",
    "params": {
      "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
      "capabilities": {},
      "clientInfo": {"name": "my-client", "version": "1.0"}
    }
  }'
# Response includes Mcp-Session-Id header - save it for subsequent requests
```

### 3. Start a Scan

`url_scanner_scan` supports two execution modes (the same modes apply to `url_scanner_scan_with_intent`):
- **Task-augmented (recommended)**: Include the `task` parameter for async execution
- **Direct**: Omit the `task` parameter for synchronous execution

```bash
curl -X POST https://urlcheck.ai/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 2,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "url_scanner_scan",
      "arguments": {
        "url": "https://example.com"
      },
      "task": {
        "ttl": 720000
      }
    }
  }'
# If stateful mode is enabled, include: -H "Mcp-Session-Id: YOUR_SESSION_ID"
```

Response (task submitted):
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "task": {
      "taskId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "status": "working",
      "statusMessage": "Queued for processing",
      "createdAt": "2026-01-18T12:00:00Z",
      "lastUpdatedAt": "2026-01-18T12:00:00Z",
      "ttl": 720000,
      "pollInterval": 2000
    }
  }
}
```

Optional: Provide an url visiting intent for additional context (recommended but not required):

```bash
curl -X POST https://urlcheck.ai/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 3,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "url_scanner_scan_with_intent",
      "arguments": {
        "url": "https://example.com",
        "intent": "Book a hotel room"
      },
      "task": {
        "ttl": 720000
      }
    }
  }'
```

### 4. Poll for Results

```bash
curl -X POST https://urlcheck.ai/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 3,
    "method": "tasks/result",
    "params": {
      "taskId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    }
  }'
# If stateful mode is enabled, include: -H "Mcp-Session-Id: YOUR_SESSION_ID"
```

Response (completed task with agent directive):
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "result": {
    "contentType": "application/json",
    "value": {
      "risk_score": 0.05,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "analysis_complete": true,
      "agent_access_directive": "ALLOW",
      "agent_access_reason": "clean"
    },
    "summary": "URL scan completed"
  }
}
```
