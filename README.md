## Repository Rename Notice

This repository was renamed from `cybrlab-ai/url-scanner-mcp` to `cybrlab-ai/urlcheck-mcp`.

- Canonical repository URL: `https://github.com/cybrlab-ai/urlcheck-mcp`
- Canonical Git remote: `git@github.com:cybrlab-ai/urlcheck-mcp.git`
- GitHub Action consumers must update `uses:` references to `cybrlab-ai/urlcheck-mcp@...` (old action paths are not guaranteed to redirect)
- Collaborators should update local remotes:
  - `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:cybrlab-ai/urlcheck-mcp.git`
  - `git fetch origin --verbose`

Do not create a new repository at the old name (`url-scanner-mcp`) to avoid breaking GitHub redirect behavior.

## Overview

URLCheck is an MCP server that enables AI agents and any MCP-compatible client to analyze URLs for malicious content and security threats before navigation.

## OpenClaw Quick Start (Manual-First)

OpenClaw users can connect URLCheck through their existing MCP bridge/adapter plugin.

- Setup guide: [OpenClaw Setup](docs/OPENCLAW_SETUP.md)
- No ClawHub skill required
- Hosted endpoint: `https://urlcheck.ai/mcp`

## Authentication Modes

| Deployment                         | `X-API-Key` Requirement         | Notes                                 |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Hosted (`https://urlcheck.ai/mcp`) | Optional up to 100 requests/day | API key recommended for higher limits |
| Hosted (`https://urlcheck.ai/mcp`) | Required above trial quota      | Contact support for provisioned keys  |

## Important Notice

This tool is intended for authorized security assessment only. Use it solely on systems or websites that you own or for which you have got explicit permission to assess. Any unauthorized, unlawful, or malicious use is strictly prohibited. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.

### Use Cases

- Pre-flight URL validation for AI agents
- Automated URL security scanning in workflows
- Malicious link detection in emails/messages

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Your MCP Client

Choose one option:

Trial (hosted, up to 100 requests/day without API key):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "urlcheck-mcp": {
      "transport": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://urlcheck.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Authenticated (recommended for stable and higher-volume usage):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "urlcheck-mcp": {
      "transport": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://urlcheck.ai/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Optional: Initialize Session (stateful mode only)

```bash
# Only required if the server is running in stateful mode
curl -X POST https://urlcheck.ai/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "initialize",
    "params": {
      "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
      "capabilities": {},
      "clientInfo": {"name": "my-client", "version": "1.0"}
    }
  }'
# Response includes Mcp-Session-Id header - save it for subsequent requests
```

### 3. Start a Scan

`url_scanner_scan` supports two execution modes (the same modes apply to `url_scanner_scan_with_intent`):
- **Task-augmented (recommended)**: Include the `task` parameter for async execution
- **Direct**: Omit the `task` parameter for synchronous execution

```bash
curl -X POST https://urlcheck.ai/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 2,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "url_scanner_scan",
      "arguments": {
        "url": "https://example.com"
      },
      "task": {
        "ttl": 720000
      }
    }
  }'
# If stateful mode is enabled, include: -H "Mcp-Session-Id: YOUR_SESSION_ID"
```

Response (task submitted):
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "task": {
      "taskId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "status": "working",
      "statusMessage": "Queued for processing",
      "createdAt": "2026-01-18T12:00:00Z",
      "lastUpdatedAt": "2026-01-18T12:00:00Z",
      "ttl": 720000,
      "pollInterval": 2000
    }
  }
}
```

Optional: Provide an url visiting intent for additional context (recommended but not required):

```bash
curl -X POST https://urlcheck.ai/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 3,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "url_scanner_scan_with_intent",
      "arguments": {
        "url": "https://example.com",
        "intent": "Book a hotel room"
      },
      "task": {
        "ttl": 720000
      }
    }
  }'
```

Recommendation: Use `url_scanner_scan_with_intent` when you can state your purpose (login, purchase, booking, payments, file download)—this enables detection of sites that don't match the stated intent. Otherwise use `url_scanner_scan`.
Max intent length: 248 characters.

### 4. Poll for Results

```bash
curl -X POST https://urlcheck.ai/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 3,
    "method": "tasks/result",
    "params": {
      "taskId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    }
  }'
# If stateful mode is enabled, include: -H "Mcp-Session-Id: YOUR_SESSION_ID"
```

Response (completed task with agent directive):
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "result": {
    "contentType": "application/json",
    "value": {
      "risk_score": 0.05,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "analysis_complete": true,
      "agent_access_directive": "ALLOW",
      "agent_access_reason": "clean"
    },
    "summary": "URL scan completed"
  }
}
```
